Installing and using SLIB


Larceny supports SLIB via SRFI 96, not via a larceny.init
file.  That gives the Larceny developers control of the
file(s) that implement SRFI 96, so they can upgrade its
implementation at any time while maintaining Larceny's
coding standards.  The SLIB developers remain responsible
for the SLIB files themselves, and can maintain the SLIB
coding standards.

SLIB redefines Larceny's require procedure.  That breaks
all of Larceny's support for dynamic loading of non-SLIB
libraries, which include SRFI, ERR5RS, R6RS, and many
Larceny-specific libraries such as Larceny's general
interface to libraries written in C.  We hope to resolve
this conflict in future versions of Larceny, but for now
we can offer only the following workaround.

If you use SLIB, you should require all SRFI and other
libraries that might be needed by your program before
you require srfi-96.  Once you have used Larceny's
require procedure to load srfi-96, you will no longer
be able to require non-SLIB libraries.


DOWNLOADING

SLIB is available for downloading at
http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html


INSTALLATION

Download SLIB and unpack it into Larceny's lib/SLIB directory.
Then create the slibcat catalog in Larceny's root directory
as follows:

    % ./larceny
    Larceny v0.96 "Fluoridation"
    > (require 'srfi-96)
    > (require 'new-catalog)
    > (exit)


USING SLIB

After your program has loaded all of the non-SLIB libraries
it might need, use Larceny's require procedure to load the
SRFI 96 interface to the SLIB system:

    (require 'srfi-96)

SLIB will then be operational.  Please consult the SLIB
documentation for detailed usage of SLIB.

Please report bugs in SLIB to the maintainers of SLIB.
Please report bugs in Larceny's implementation of SRFI
96 to the Larceny developers.  When in doubt, report
bugs to the Larceny developers; if we determine that
the bug is in SLIB, we will forward the report to the
maintainers of SLIB.
