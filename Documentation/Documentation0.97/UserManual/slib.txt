SLIB support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html[SLIB]
is a large collection of useful libraries that have been
written or collected by Aubrey Jaffer.

Larceny supports SLIB via
http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-96/[SRFI 96],
but SLIB itself is not shipped with Larceny;
it must be downloaded separately and then installed.
For the most up-to-date information on installing and using
SLIB with Larceny, see +doc/HOWTO-SLIB+.
