Information about Petit Larceny on MacOS X
25 November 2004 / lth

NOTE FOR Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) USERS:
The version of GCC distributed with Tiger eats up memory
on particular C programs.  If you see similar behavior,
run the command "% /usr/sbin/gcc_select 3.3" to switch
to GCC 3.3.

HOW TO BUILD AND USE.

See HOWTO-BUILD and HOWTO-PETIT for information about this.  The file
to load is Util/petit-unix-be.sch; there are no surprises.


COMPILING AND LOADING YOUR OWN PROGRAMS

If you want to use dynamic loading of files compiled with COMPILE-FILES
then you must:

  - Install the dlcompat package from the opendarwin project:
	http://www.opendarwin.org/
	http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat/

  - Make sure HAVE_DLFCN is defined in features.sch before you
    evaluate BUILD-CONFIG-FILES

If you do these two things then dynamic loading of files should
generally work OK.


USEFUL SITES

The Fink project has some information about getting Unix programs
to work on MacOS X:

TODO.

* Implement the foreign function interface
* Implement polling input with select()
* Problems with mmap -- function exists but Larceny gets a failure, appears
  to need extra magic on this platform (problem experienced with 10.1.5)
* Performance investigation -- various jump disciplines, other
  build options.
