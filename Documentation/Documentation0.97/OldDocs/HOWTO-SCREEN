Information about how to use SCREEN.
$Id$


"screen" is a useful program for managing one or more long-running
computations when being logged in from start to end is not an option.

'man screen' produces a pretty much incomprehensible manual page.

To run screen, just type 'screen'.  This starts a shell.  Use the new
shell as you would any other shell, _except_ note that C-a is the screen
escape character.  (Thus navigation in Emacs is somewhat unpleasant.)
The command "C-a ?" produces some unhelpful help text.

In your new shell, start your program, whatever it is.

Now type C-a d ("detatch") to detach the screen session; this also
terminates your screen process and returns you to your login shell.
Your program continues to run in the background, and unlike other forms
of background execution, will not be stopped when it produces output.
You can now log out, start another program, or whatever.

When you have logged back in, type 'screen -r' at your shell to "resume"
the detached session.  Buffered output, if any, is spewed at you, and
you observe that the program has finished running (or not).  You are now
interacting with the program, and when that's finished, with the shell
you got when you started screen the first time.  You terminate that
shell by exiting from it, in normal fashion.

If you have several screen sessions, you can use 'screen -ls' to list
them, and you can use the IDs thus listed as an extra argument to
'screen -r' to attach to any particular one.
