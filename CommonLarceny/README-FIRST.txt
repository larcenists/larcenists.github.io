SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Currently, this software is distributed for
 - Windows on Intel x86 machines, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0

You can make Common Larceny work on other platforms (e.g. Mac OS X
with the Mono Framework 1.1) but we do not yet provide support for
those systems.


WHAT YOU NEED

To run the interpreter, you will first need to set the LARCENY_ROOT
environment variable explicitly to the Larceny's distribution's path 
before running Common Larceny. Otherwise, everything else should
work "out of the box".

To compile files, the development tools (e.g. ilasm) must be in your
search path.  Also, for now you must have Twobit.fasl and Twobit.exe
in the current directory when you start the compiler.

To run with auto-compilation of loaded files, for now you must have
Larceny.fasl and Larceny.exe in the current directory when you start
the runtime.  Note that the compiler itself has not been optimized,
and so there is a noticeable delay when loading source in this mode.


QUICK START

CommonLarceny (Win32):
 - If you want to run with auto-compilation of Scheme source loaded
   with the load procedure, run
   > CommonLarceny Larceny.fasl

 - If you're content to use only the interpreter, run
   > CommonLarceny

Do not run Larceny.exe; it is not a standalone application.


COMPILING SCHEME SOURCE WITH LARCENY

 - (compile-file <SOURCE> [<TARGET>])
   (compile-file "source.sch")
     compiles "source.sch", leaving the compiled code in "source.fasl"

   (compile-file "source.sch" "target.fasl")
     compiles "source.sch", leaving the compiled code in "target.fasl"

 - (load "target.fasl")
     loads the compiled code in "target.fasl"
