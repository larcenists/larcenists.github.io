<h2>
Twobit Pass 4: frame optimization
</h2>

<p>
Twobit's code generator requires a stack frame whenever:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A procedure call occurs in a non-tail-recursive position.
<li>A temporary must be allocated, but no registers are
    available.
</ul>

<p>
When should these stack frames be allocated and deallocated?

<p>
Some compilers allocate a stack frame upon entry to every
procedure.  This is inefficient for procedures that may
contain non-tail-recursive calls but seldom perform them.

<p>
Some compilers allocate a separate stack frame for every
non-tail-recursive call.  This is inefficient for procedures
that perform many such calls.

<p>
Twobit performs a simple optimization to reduce the
overhead of creating and initializing stack frames.
The goals of this optimization are:

<p>
<ol>
<li>To create no more than one stack frame per procedure
    activation.
<li>To create a stack frame only when necessary.
</ol>

<p>
It is not always possible to achieve both of these goals.
Twobit always achieves the first goal, but it sometimes
creates an unnecessary stack frame.
<a href="#chez">Chez Scheme</a>
always achieves the second goal but does not
always achieve the first.

<p>
<h3>Control flow graphs</h3>

<p>
In the subset of Scheme that Twobit uses as its
<a href="syntax.html">intermediate form</a>,
an expression represents straight-line code unless
it contains a conditional expression or a non-tail-recursive
procedure call.
If non-tail calls are regarded as basic blocks with
unknown effects, then the body of a lambda expression
becomes an acyclic control flow graph with multiple
exit points.
The number of exit points is equal to 1 plus the number
of conditional expressions that occur in a tail-recursive
position.
Fork points arise from conditional expressions, and come
right after the test.

<p>
For example, the doubly recursive Fibonacci procedure

<p>
<pre>
  (define fib
    (lambda (n)
      (if (< n 2)
          n
          (+ (fib (- n 1))
             (fib (- n 2))))))
</pre>

<p>
contains one fork point and two exit points.
Its control flow graph is

<p>
<pre>
                     ----------
                     |  entry |
                     ----------
                          |
                          |
                          *
                        *   *
                      *       *
                        *   *
                      /   *   \
                    /           \
                  /               \
                /                   \
            *********        *****************
            *   n   *        * (fib (- n 1)) *
            *********        *****************
                                     |
                             *****************
                             * (fib (- n 2)) *
                             *****************
                                     |
                             *****************
                             *       +       *
                             *****************
</pre>

<p>
There are only two kinds of positions within a control
flow graph at which Twobit might allocate a stack frame:

<p>
<ul>
<li>At entry.
<li>After a conditional test has selected one of two branches.
</ul>

<p>
Let's call these positions the
<dfn>save positions</dfn>.
If a stack frame is needed anywhere in the control flow
graph, then at least one save position will dominate all
places where a stack frame is needed.  These dominating
save positions are totally ordered by the control flow
graph.
Twobit will allocate a stack frame at the last save
position that dominates all places where a stack frame is
needed.

<p>
If no stack frame is needed, then Twobit will not allocate one.

<p>
For the Fibonacci example, Twobit will not allocate a stack
frame for the base case.  In the recursive case, Twobit will
allocate a stack frame immediately after the test has
determined that the recursive branch will be taken.

<p>
<h3>Frame optimization</h3>

<p>
Twobit generates a <code>save</code> instruction,
which allocates a stack frame, at entry.
The internal representation of the operand for this
<code>save</code> instruction is a mutable data structure
that the code generator uses to keep track of the maximum
number of data slots within the frame that are live at any
time.
This maximum is initialized to -1.

<p>
Twobit generates code as though a stack frame has been
allocated.
Any use of the stack frame will ensure a non-negative value
for the operand of the nearest <code>save</code> instruction that
dominates the use.
When the code generator reaches a new save position, it
checks the mutable data structure to see whether
a stack frame has been required to that point.
If so, then it does not generate a <code>save</code> instruction
at that save position, but continues to use the data structure
for the previously generated <code>save</code> instruction.
If no stack frame has been required, however,
then it generates another <code>save</code> instruction,
with a new mutable data structure as its operand.

<p>
A <code>pop</code> instruction is generated for returns
and tail-recursive calls.  Its operand matches the operand
of the nearest <code>save</code> instruction that dominates it.
The <a href="pass5.html">local optimizer</a>
and <a href="assembly.html">assembler</a>
ignore <code>save</code> and <code>pop</code> instructions
whose operand is -1.

<p>
<h3><a name="chez">Comparison with Chez Scheme</a></h3>

<p>
Twobit's frame optimization is conservative in the sense that
no procedure activation ever allocates more than one frame.
Sometimes a stack frame will be allocated when none is actually
needed, however.
Consider

<p>
<pre>
  (define f
    (lambda (x y z)
      (if (> x 0)
          (show x))
      (if (> y 0)
          (show y))
      (if (> z 0)
          (show z))
      (list x y z)))
</pre>

<p>
Twobit will allocate a stack frame for <code>f</code>
even if all of its arguments are zero.
Chez Scheme would not.
On the other hand, Chez Scheme would allocate three
separate stack frames for <code>f</code> if
all of its arguments are positive.
Twobit would allocate only one.

<p>
The algorithm used in Chez Scheme is a form of total
redundacy elimination for register saves.

<p>
Frame optimization in Twobit is similar to partial
redundancy elimination, but is not quite the same.
For example, Twobit will generate code to allocate
a stack frame within each arm of the conditional
expression in

<p>
<pre>
  (define f
    (lambda (n)
      (if (< n 2)
          (begin (show n)
                 n)
          (+ (f (- n 1))
             (f (- n 2))))))
</pre>

<p>
Partial redundancy elimination would reduce code space
by hoisting this code to a common dominator.
