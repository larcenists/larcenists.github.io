<h1>
Twobit Pass 1: standardization of syntax.
</h1>

<p>
Pass 1 collects information needed for optimization while
converting a Scheme definition or expression into the front end's
<a href="syntax.html">intermediate form</a>.
It performs
<abug href="bugs.html#hygienic">hygienic macro expansion</abug>,
eliminates internal definitions,
checks syntax, and gives a unique name to each local variable
(<em>alpha conversion</em>).
Pass 1 also creates for each local variable a table
containing all references, assignments, and procedure calls
to that variable.

If the <code>integrate-usual-procedures</code> compiler switch
is true, then Pass 1 performs some
<abug href="bugs.html#folding">constant folding</abug> and normalizes
the number of arguments passed to procedures such as <code>+</code>
and <code>make-vector</code>.

<a name="example1">As an example</a>, Pass 1 converts

                                         (.check! (pair? .x|15|18) '0 .x|15|18)
                                         (.car:pair .x|15|18)))

<p>
This would be a legal expression of IEEE Scheme,
except the renamed identifers are illegal:
They have been prefixed by a period and contain a vertical bar.
These illegal characters prevent any conflict with the names of
legal global variables, which are not renamed.
When Twobit is used as a preprocessor,
legal but obscure sequences of characters are used instead of the
period and vertical bar.

<p>
<a name="defelimination">The internal definition</a>
of <code>loop</code> has been converted
into a <code>LET</code> that binds <code>.loop|2</code> to a newly
allocated location whose contents are undefined, and then stores
the result of a lambda expression into that location.
That is a literal rendering of the official semantics for an
internal definition in Scheme, but most optimizing compilers do not
expand internal definitions and <code>LETREC</code>s to such a low
level.

<p>
Calls to certain of Scheme's standard library procedures, including
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, have been expanded into calls
to low-level procedures that are protected by explicit run-time checks.

<p>
The output of Pass 1 has several important properties:
<ul>
<li>There are no internal definitions.
<li>No identifier is bound in more than one place.
<li>No identifier contains an upper case letter.
</ul>

<p>
Since there are no internal definitions in the output of Pass 1,
<a href="pass2.html">Pass 2</a> has only seven kinds of expression
to optimize.
