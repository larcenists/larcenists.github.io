<h2>
Twobit Pass 4: closure conversion.
</h2>

<p>
Twobit represents procedures and environments as specially tagged
arrays whose elements contain code, cells for global variables
mentioned by the code, the values of constants and non-global
free variables mentioned by the code, and a static link to
another environment.
Each such array is called a rib.

<p>
Lambda lifting results in flat or nearly flat closures.
Static measurements from Twobit compiling itself show that over
90% of the sites that create a closure create a flat closure with
only 1 rib.
Over 98% of these sites create a closure that contain only 1 or 2
ribs.  It does not appear worthwhile to use display closures as
in Chez Scheme, since they are advantageous only for closures with
3 or more ribs.

<p>
Twobit generates code to close every lambda expression, but multiple
lambda expressions often share a closure.
Twobit generates code to create a closure whenever:
<ul>
<li>A lambda expression is not the right hand side of an internal
    definition, and is not the operator of a call.
<li>The body of a lambda expression contains internal definitions.
    The right hand sides of the internal definitions share this
    closure.
<li>A lambda expression takes so many arguments that few registers
    remain available for temporaries.
</ul>
