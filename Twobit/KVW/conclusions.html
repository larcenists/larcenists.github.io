Conclusions Reconsidered
</title>

<body>

<p>
A few of Kernighan and Van Wyk's conclusions about the performance
of Scheme resulted from their choice of an extremely slow interpreter
as their canonical implementation of Scheme.
What would they have concluded if they had benchmarked a compiler
instead?

<p>
<hr>

<p>
One of Kernighan and Van Wyk's conclusions was that purely functional
tail recursion is no faster in Scheme than an imperative style that
performs assignments to global variables:

<p>
<blockquote>
we wrote two Scheme versions of the timing loop, string construction,
and word count, one using the tail-recursion favored by Scheme aficionados,
the other using the barbarian import <code>set!</code>;
the difference in performance
between the two versions never exceeded ten percent, and did not
consistently favor one version over the other.
</blockquote>

<p>
In Larceny, however, the
<a href="sumloop2.txt">tail recursive version of the timing loop</a>
is over three times as fast as the version using <code>set!</code>.
The tail recursive version is only twenty percent faster in Gambit-C
(with fixnum arithmetic) and in Chez Scheme, but that is still a
dramatic difference.

<p>
This difference does not exist with the interpreted implementations,
nor with the other two benchmarks mentioned above,
because the overhead of interpretation, string manipulation,
or character i/o are so dominant that they mask the expense of
assignments.

<p>
It is also worth noting that Scheme's <code>do</code> construct,
which Kernighan and Van Wyk characterized as an iteration construct
"for unreconstructed imperative-style programmers",
is not imperative at all:
The loop variables are updated by binding, as in any other tail
recursion, not by assignment.
In compiled implementations of Scheme, the <code>do</code> construct
has exactly the same overhead as the tail recursion for which it is
an abbreviation.

<p>

<p>
Concerning Scheme's poor i/o performance, Kernighan and Van Wyk
concluded that

<p>
<blockquote>
The enormous Scheme runtimes appear to be caused by the lack of
facilities for buffered input and output.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is true, although Chez Scheme shows that Scheme can get to
within a factor of 2 of C even on i/o benchmarks.
It is almost entirely a matter of implementation effort,
and I hope the Kernighan and Van Wyk i/o benchmarks will encourage
Scheme implementors to improve their i/o performance.
(That's easy for me to say, because we've already made these
improvements in a more recent version of Larceny.)

<p>
<hr>

<p>
<blockquote>
Scheme appears to be very roughly comparable with Tcl...various
compilation techniques improve this behavior.
</blockquote>

On Kernighan and Van Vyk's four computational (as opposed to i/o)
benchmarks, compiled Scheme ranges from 6 times as slow to
4 times as fast as unoptimized gcc.
This range of results is typical for micro-benchmarks that compare
compiled Scheme with compiled C.
