<h1>
Twobit Pass 2: source-level optimization.
</h1>

<p>
Most of Twobit's optimizations occur during Pass 2, which
consists of one
post-order pass over the expression tree output by
<a href="pass1.html">Pass 1</a>.

<p>
That expression tree contains no internal definitions.
The main goal of optimization is to detect known local
procedures, to record them as internal definitions, and
to hoist these internal definitions to a more global
scope where they will be evaluated less frequently.

<p>
The two most important optimizations in Pass 2 are
<a href="p2saa.html">single assignment analysis</a>,
which detects assignments that can be converted into
internal definitions of
<a href="p2background.html#known">known local procedures</a>, and
<a href="p2lifting.html">incremental lambda lifting</a>,
which hoists the known local procedures of nested lambda
expressions to their enclosing lambda expression.

<p>
These are also the most original of the optimizations
used in Twobit.  They are variations of two well-known
optimizations,
<a href="p2background.html#closure">closure analysis</a> and
<a href="p2background.html#lifting">lambda lifting</a>, which
are used by most compilers for higher order languages.

<a name="rev2">For the</a>
<a href="pass1.html#example1"><code>reverse-map</code></a>
example, the output of Pass 2 is

<p>
<pre>
(begin
  (set! reverse-map
    (lambda (.f|1 .l|1)
      (define .loop|2
        (lambda (.f|1|6 .l|3 .x|3)
          (if (pair? .l|3)
            (.loop|2
              .f|1|6
              (cdr .l|3)
              (cons (.f|1|6 (car .l|3)) .x|3))
            .x|3)))
      (begin (unspecified)
             (.loop|2 .f|1 .l|1 '()))))
  'reverse-map)
</pre>

<p>
An optional Pass 3, to perform flow analysis and representation
inference, has not yet been released.
For these notes we will assume that the
output of Pass 2 goes directly to the
<a href="pass4.html">code generator</a>.
