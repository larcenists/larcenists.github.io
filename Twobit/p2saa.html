Twobit Pass2: single assignment analysis
</title>

<body>

<p>
<h2>Single assignment analysis</h2>

<p>
Single assignment analysis combines
<a href="p2background.html#firstorder">first order closure analysis</a>
with an inverse of the Scheme-specific
<a href="pass1.html#defelimination">Pass 1 transformation</a>
that eliminated all internal definitions.

<p>
Single assignment analysis identifies
any formal parameters that are assigned exactly once, at the
head of the lambda body, to the result of a lambda expression, 
and are
<abug href="bugs.html#saa">called as often as they are referenced</abug>.
Such parameters
are actually the names of local procedures whose call points are
all visible to the compiler.  There is no need to create a closure
for such procedures, since the environment in which they are
declared will be accessible from the environment in effect at
each place where they are called.  This fact is recorded by
transforming
<p>
<pre>
  (lambda (... I ...)
    (begin D ...)
    (begin (set! I L) E1 ...))
</pre>
<p>
into
<p>
<pre>
   (lambda (... IGNORED ...)
     (begin (define I L) D ...)
     (begin E1 ...))
</pre>
<p>
in which the single assignment has become an internal definition.
For example, the assignment to <code>.loop|2</code> in the
<a href="pass1.html#example1">output of Pass 1</a>
becomes an internal definition during Pass 2:

<p>
<pre>
((begin
   (set! reverse-map
     (lambda (.f|1 .l|1)
       (define .loop|2
         (lambda (.l|3 .x|3)
           (if (pair? .l|3)
               (.loop|2
                 (let ((.x|6|9 .l|3))
                   (begin
                     (.check! (pair? .x|6|9) 1 .x|6|9)
                     (.cdr:pair .x|6|9)))
                 (cons (.f|1 (let ((.x|15|18 .l|3))
                               (begin
                                 (.check! (pair? .x|15|18) 0 .x|15|18)
                                 (.car:pair .x|15|18))))
                       .x|3))
               .x|3)))
       (.loop|2 .l|1 '())))
   'reverse-map))
</pre>

<p>
It may seem that nothing has been accomplished by converting the
original internal definition into an assignment, only to convert
it back into an internal definition.

<p>
The point is that an internal definition in the output of Pass 2
records a known local procedure, whereas an internal definition in
the original code may define a variable whose value is not even a
procedure, or whose value is changed by assignments, or whose value
is a procedure that must be represented as a closure because it is
passed as an argument.
In other words, Twobit uses the internal definition syntax as a handy
notation for known local procedures, whereas Scheme programmers use
that syntax for allocation and initialization of arbitrary variables.

<p>
Twobit's single assignment analysis also checks to make sure every
call to a known local
procedure passes the correct number of arguments.  If the known
local procedure has a rest parameter, the rest parameter is replaced
by an ordinary parameter and the excess arguments in each call to
that known procedure are replaced by an open-coded call to
<code>LIST</code>.
