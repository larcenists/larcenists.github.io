<h2><a name="closure">Closure analysis</a></h2>

<p>
In block-structured languages, a procedure is more than its
code.  The procedure must also incorporate the environment
in which its code was declared.  Without this environment,
references to variables that occur free in its code could
not be resolved.

<p>
A <dfn>closure</dfn> is a run-time data structure that represents a
procedure by representing both its code and the environment
in which that code was declared, or closed.
Closure analysis is an interprocedural static analysis that
seeks to avoid the creation of closures where possible, and
to choose the most efficient representation for those closures
that must be created.

<p>
Closure analysis is utterly trivial for C.  Since all
procedures are closed in the global environment, there is
never any reason to create a closure.

<p>
In most block-structured languages, no
procedure outlives the activation of the block in which
it is declared.
Most non-global procedures are called only from sites within
their scope that name the procedure explicitly.  There is no
need to create a closure for such procedures, since the
environment in which they were declared can be computed at
each call site.

<p>
A closure does have to be created for a procedure that is
passed as an argument.  Most Pascal compilers create this
closure when the procedure is passed.  The environment
part of the closure can be represented as a pointer into
the stack.

<p>
In higher order languages that allow a procedure to outlive
the block in which it is declared, closure analysis becomes
a very important and nontrivial optimization.
Without closure analysis, a closure must be allocated for
every procedure.  Since a procedure's free variables must
live as long as the procedure, every variable that occurs
free within the code for some procedure must be allocated on
the heap.

<p>
<a name="firstorder">Higher order</a>
closure analysis usually eliminates most heap
allocation of closures and variables but requires cubic time.
In practice, most of the benefit is achieved by optimizing
only named procedures that are never referenced outside the
operator position of a call.
This is known as first order closure analysis; it suffices to
eliminate heap allocation of closures and variables for all
first order programs.

<p>
Passive closure analysis is content to analyze the program
as it was written by the programmer.  With passive analysis,
and especially with first order passive analysis, a single
lambda expression in an argument position can wreak havoc by
closing over variables that name procedures for which no
closure would otherwise have to be created.  If the procedure
in argument position has an unknown lifetime, all of the
procedures to which it refers will have an unknown lifetime.
All of the variables and procedures to which they refer will
have an unknown lifetime, and so on.  It is quite possible
that all variables and procedures whose scope contains the
escaping lambda expression will have to be allocated on the
heap.

<p>
<h2><a name="lifting">Lambda lifting</a></h2>

<p>
Lambda lifting is an optimization that actively rewrites a
program in an attempt to reduce the heap allocation required
when a procedure's lifetime cannot be statically determined.

<p>
<a name="known">When the compiler can find</a>
all of the call sites for a local
procedure, and the compiler can determine that each of those
sites can call only that one procedure, then that procedure
is referred to as a <dfn>known local procedure</dfn>.
In practice, most known local procedures can be found by a
<a href="#firstorder">first order closure analysis</a>.

<p>
The compiler can use nonstandard calling conventions to call
a known local procedure, since it can rewrite each call site.

<p>
In particular, the compiler can change each call site to
pass some or all of that procedure's free variables as extra
arguments.
This may allow the compiler to hoist its declaration to an
outer scope.
This hoisting of known local procedures is called
<dfn>lambda lifting</dfn>.

<p>
Lambda lifting has several benefits:
<ul>
<li>It removes free variables (by adding extra arguments),
    which reduces the number of variables that must be
    captured by the procedure's closure.
<li>It groups procedures so they can share a common closure in
    a common environment, which reduces heap allocation.
<li>It tends to reduce the dynamic frequency of closure creation
    by moving lambda expressions to less frequently executed sites.
<li>It tends to move most procedures to a global scope, where
    no closures need to be created.
<li>It exposes free variables to interprocedural register targeting.
</ul>

<p>
The main disadvantage of lambda lifting is that it adds extra
arguments to known local procedures.
If too many extra arguments are added, the cost of passing
the extra arguments and of saving them in stack frames may be 
greater than the benefits.
When arguments are viewed as registers, as in Twobit, then
this tradeoff becomes a matter of interprocedural register
allocation.

<p>
Lambda lifting also incurs the compile-time cost of solving a
<a href="p2lifting.html#flowequation">flow equation</a>
to determine which arguments must be added.
Most compilers that perform lambda lifting solve this equation
only once, to find the arguments that must be added in order to
lift known local procedures to the global environment.
If the number of arguments appears excessive, a procedure will
not be lifted at all.

<p>
This all-or-nothing approach can be suboptimal.  Sometimes it
is best to lift a known local procedure only part of the way
to the outermost level of a program.

<p>
Olivier Danvy has considered lambda dropping, which follows
lambda lifting by dropping some of the lifted procedures down
into scopes that allow some of the added arguments to be
converted back into free variables.
Lambda dropping can be done without solving any more flow
equations, but can result in passing arguments to procedures
that don't use them.

<p>
<h2><a name="inclifting">Incremental lambda lifting</a></h2>

<p>
Twobit uses <dfn>incremental lambda lifting</dfn>, which
lifts a group of known local procedures only one scope
at a time.  The advantage of incremental lifting is that
it can stopped at any intermediate scope.

<p>
The output of Pass 1 always contains a single outermost lambda
expression.  By the end of Pass 2, it is usually the case that
all known local procedures have been hoisted to that outermost
lambda expression.
When this is not the case, it is because the compiler's
<a href="p2custom.html#lifting">heuristics</a>
have predicted that better code will result from hoisting some
known local procedures only part of the way, or not at all.

<p>
One disadvantage of incremental lambda lifting is that a
<a href="p2lifting.html#flowequation">flow equation</a>
must be solved for each scope.
The <a href="p2lifting.html#cost">compile-time cost of incremental lambda
lifting</a> is not a major issue, however.

<p>
Another problem with lambda lifting in general is that a known
procedure generally cannot be lifted past the binding of a variable
that appears on the left hand side of an assignment.
Lambda lifting in Twobit is therefore preceded by optimizations
that remove all assignments to local variables.
These optimizations begin with
<a href="p2local.html">local source transformations</a>.
