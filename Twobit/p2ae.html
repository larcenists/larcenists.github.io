Twobit Pass 2: assignment elimination
</title>

<body>

<p>
<h2>Assignment elimination</h2>

<p>
Following single assignment analysis and single assignment elimination,
assignment elimination finds all
remaining local variables that appear on the left hand side of an
assignment.  If any such variables <code>I1</code> ... are found, then
the body of the lambda expression being optimized is replaced by
a <code>LET</code> of the form
<pre>
  ((lambda (V1 ...) ...)
   (MAKE-CELL I1) ...)
</pre>
in which all references to such variables are replaced by calls to
<code>CELL-REF</code>,
and all assignments by calls to <code>CELL-SET!</code>.
The <code>MAKE-CELL</code> procedure allocates heap storage for the variable,
which is essentially replaced by a pointer to that storage.
Assignment elimination makes all local variables immutable as in
Standard ML, so they can be copied freely, which greatly
simplifies lambda lifting.

<p>
The storage for an assigned variable must be allocated on the heap
if that variable is accessible from any procedure whose lifetime
cannot be bounded.
Programmers should realize that
<abug href="bugs.html#ae">assignments are more expensive</abug> in
higher order languages than in most imperative languages.

<p>
After assignment elimination has eliminated all assignments to
the local variables of a lambda expression, the known local
procedures of that lambda expression can be
<a href="p2lifting.html">lifted</a> to the next outer lambda
expression.
