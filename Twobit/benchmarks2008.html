<h1>Benchmarks</h1>
<p>
Last updated 23 July 2008.
</p>

<p>
We have graphed the performance of several implementations
of the R6RS on a set of
<a href="benchmarksAboutR6.html">R6RS benchmarks</a>
collected by Will Clinger.
These
<a href="benchmarksAboutR6.html">R6RS benchmarks</a>
include improved versions of most
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/bench.html">
Gambit benchmarks</a> (collected by Marc Feeley)
and also include new benchmarks that test some
of the more important features that were introduced by the R6RS.
</p>

<p>
Please keep in mind that the results of benchmarking
<a href="bmcrock.temp.html">should not be taken too seriously</a>.

<h2>Genuine R6RS Benchmarks</h2>

<p>
The R6RS-conforming <strong>Genuine R6RS</strong> benchmarks
consist of portable R6RS top-level programs.
We have timings for three very different machines:
</p>
<div>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="benchmarksGenuineR6Linux.html">2.8 GHz Pentium
        (Linux)</a>
    <li><a href="benchmarksGenuineR6Solaris.html">1.5 GHz SunBlade 1500
        (Solaris)</a>
    <li><a href="benchmarksGenuineR6MacOSXppc.html">800 MHz PowerBook G4
        (MacOS X PowerPC)</a>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>The Benchmarked Systems</h3>

<p>
As of this writing, there appear to be only five systems
that implement enough of the R6RS
to make benchmarking worthwhile.
We benchmarked all five:
</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/">Larceny</a>
    v0.962
    (Linux and Solaris only)</li>
<li><a href="http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/">Petit Larceny</a>
    v0.962</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/ikarus/">Ikarus</a>
    0.0.3
    (Linux only)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme</a>
    v4.0.2
    </li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ypsilon/">Ypsilon</a>
    0.9.5-update1
    (Linux only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explanation of Timings</h2>

<p>
The numbers shown are for a single run on a machine with no other users,
and give the elapsed time in seconds for a single run on
a machine with no other users.
The bar graphs show relative performance.  Longer is better.
</p>

<p>
Where no timing is shown for a system, the system was unable
to run the benchmark correctly.  We believe that
<a href="benchmarkMissing.txt">all missing timings</a>
reflect a bug or implementation restriction in the system
that was unable to run the benchmark.
